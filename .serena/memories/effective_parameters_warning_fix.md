# Effective Parameters Warning Fix

## Issue Fixed (2025-08-18)
The system was incorrectly showing "No matching rules found - service may use default check parameters" warnings even when rules were actually found and applied.

## Root Cause
**Data Structure Mismatch**: The parameter service expected a `rule_count` field that wasn't being provided by the API client.

### Technical Details
1. **Location**: `checkmk_mcp_server/services/parameter_service.py:364-367`
2. **Problem**: Checking `effective_result.get("rule_count", 0) == 0` always returned true because the field didn't exist
3. **Secondary Issue**: Async API client had incomplete implementation (just `pass`)

## Solution Applied

### 1. API Client Fix (`api_client.py`)
- Modified `_compute_effective_parameters_from_rules()` to return `(parameters, rule_count)` tuple
- Updated `get_service_effective_parameters()` to include `rule_count` in response
- Added proper type annotations: `-> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], int]`

### 2. Async Client Fix (`async_api_client.py`)  
- Added missing `@async_wrapper("get_service_effective_parameters")` decorator
- This ensures async calls properly delegate to the fixed sync implementation

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed type annotation errors throughout `api_client.py`
- Removed unused imports and variables
- Added explicit `Dict[str, Any]` type hints
- Enhanced `recovery.py` with proper Pydantic configuration

## Files Modified
- `checkmk_mcp_server/api_client.py` - Added rule_count to response, type fixes
- `checkmk_mcp_server/async_api_client.py` - Added async wrapper decorator
- `checkmk_mcp_server/services/recovery.py` - Type and validation improvements

## Testing Notes
- All existing tests pass (21/21)
- Warning now only appears when `rule_count` is actually 0
- MCP tools correctly receive rule counts through async client

## Future Considerations
When adding new fields to API responses, ensure:
1. All consumers of the API are checked for field expectations
2. Both sync and async implementations are updated
3. Type annotations are complete and accurate
