# Code Quality & Reliability Improvements

## Context
This is a fully functional hobby project (34k LOC) with working MCP integration. Recent fixes addressed service state accuracy and API endpoint issues. Focus on practical improvements that make the code more reliable and maintainable.

## Phase 1: Error Handling & Reliability (High Priority)

### 1. Better Error Handling
- Improve error messages to be more helpful for debugging
- Add better logging for API failures and connection issues
- Handle edge cases that cause crashes (like the recent falsy value issue)

### 2. Connection Reliability  
- Improve retry logic for API failures
- Better handling of network timeouts and connection errors
- Graceful handling when Checkmk server is unavailable

## Phase 2: Code Quality (Medium Priority)

### 3. Data Validation
- Add validation for API responses to catch unexpected data formats
- Better handling of missing or malformed data from Checkmk
- Validate configuration files and give helpful error messages

### 4. Code Organization
- Clean up any overly complex functions
- Add docstrings to complex business logic
- Remove dead code and unused imports

## Phase 3: User Experience (Lower Priority)

### 5. Better CLI Experience
- Improve error messages to be more user-friendly
- Add more helpful command examples
- Better handling of common user mistakes

### 6. Testing Improvements
- Add tests for recently fixed bugs to prevent regressions
- Test edge cases that caused recent issues
- Better test coverage for MCP integration

## Focus Areas (Based on Recent Issues)

**API Endpoint Confusion**: Better handling of configuration vs monitoring endpoint differences
**State Extraction**: Fix issues with falsy values and type conversions (like the recent 0 vs "Unknown" bug)
**Parameter Validation**: Better validation of MCP tool parameters to prevent crashes
**Error Messages**: Make errors more helpful for debugging

## Simple Success Metrics
- Fewer crashes and unexpected errors
- Better error messages that help with debugging
- Code that's easier to understand and modify
- Reliable MCP integration without parameter mismatches
