MCP Server Validation Package

This package contains input validation and sanitization utilities for MCP server tools.

Modules:
    - Future validation modules will be added here in later phases
    - tool_validators: Input validation for each tool category
    - Parameter sanitization and error message standardization

This module is part of the Phase 1 refactoring to modularize the monolithic
MCP server implementation.
