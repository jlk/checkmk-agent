TITLE: MCP Server Consolidation - Remove Basic, Keep Enhanced
DATE: 2025-01-31
PARTICIPANTS: jlk, Claude Code
SUMMARY: Successfully consolidated dual MCP server architecture into single unified implementation

INITIAL PROMPT: will you use sub-agents automatically, or should I ask you to? For example, I want to implement tasks/consolidate-mcp-servers.md

KEY DECISIONS:
- Confirmed actual tool counts: Basic server had 24 tools, Enhanced server had 28 tools (not 17/22 as documented)
- Decided to remove basic MCP server and make enhanced server the single unified server
- Enhanced server includes all basic functionality plus 4 advanced tools (streaming, batch ops, metrics, cache)
- Added conditional feature toggles (--enable-caching, --enable-streaming, --enable-metrics) per user feedback
- Updated all documentation to reflect single server architecture

FILES CHANGED:
- mcp_checkmk_server.py: Enhanced server entry point renamed and updated with feature toggles
- checkmk_mcp_server/mcp_server/server.py: Enhanced server implementation renamed, class name changed
- checkmk_mcp_server/mcp_server/__init__.py: Updated imports for single server
- checkmk_mcp_server/mcp_client.py: Updated default server path
- tests/test_mcp_server_tools.py: Consolidated tests, updated tool count expectations (28 tools)
- test_new_features.py: Updated MCP server import test
- README.md: Removed server comparison tables, updated to single server documentation
- CLAUDE.md: Updated MCP integration section for unified server
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md: Updated architecture references
- CHANGELOG.md: Added v2.1.0 consolidation entry
- DELETED: mcp_checkmk_enhanced_server.py (old entry point)
- DELETED: checkmk_mcp_server/mcp_server/enhanced_server.py (old implementation)

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Phase 1: Created backup branch and verified baseline (all tests passing)
- Phase 2: Deleted basic server files, renamed enhanced files to standard names
- Phase 3: Updated class names (EnhancedCheckmkMCPServer → CheckmkMCPServer)
- Phase 4: Updated imports, tests, and all documentation
- Phase 5: Added conditional feature logging based on CLI arguments
- Final verification: All 28 tools available, all tests passing

BENEFITS ACHIEVED:
- Simpler architecture and deployment (single server vs dual servers)
- No user confusion about server choice
- All users automatically get advanced features (streaming, caching, batch ops, metrics)
- Single upgrade path for new features
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Optional feature toggles for resource-conscious deployments

VERIFICATION:
- Pre-consolidation tests: ✅ PASSED
- Post-consolidation tests: ✅ PASSED  
- Tool count verification: ✅ 28 tools confirmed
- Import verification: ✅ All imports working
- CLI verification: ✅ Help shows proper arguments
- Documentation consistency: ✅ All references updated
