TITLE: Checkmk MCP Server Project Setup and Planning
DATE: 2025-01-08
PARTICIPANTS: User, Claude
SUMMARY: Initial project setup for Checkmk MCP Server with focus on host operations (list, create, delete). Created comprehensive implementation plan, requirements.txt, and project structure.

INITIAL PROMPT: I want to create a agent that connects an llm like claude or chatgpt to checkmk so that it is easier to adjust configurations in checkmk without being an expert with that tool. I'd like this to be written in Python. Let's start off by just creating support for APIs related to hosts - list, create, and delete. Once we have those working, we can work on adding more.

KEY DECISIONS:
- Use Python as the primary language for the agent
- Focus initially on host operations: list, create, and delete
- Implement both OpenAI and Anthropic LLM support
- Use Click framework for CLI interface
- Structure project with clear separation of concerns (API client, LLM client, operations)
- Use Bearer token authentication for Checkmk API
- Create comprehensive todo.md for tracking progress

FILES CHANGED:
- todo.md: Created comprehensive implementation plan with phases and tasks
- requirements.txt: Added all necessary dependencies including requests, pydantic, click, openai, anthropic
- .env.example: Created environment configuration template
- docs/conversations/2025-01/2025-01-08-0000-project-setup.md: This conversation record

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Identified key Checkmk API endpoints for hosts:
  - List: GET /domain-types/host_config/collections/all
  - Create: POST /domain-types/host_config/collections/all
  - Delete: DELETE /objects/host_config/{host_name}
- Analyzed required schemas: CreateHost (folder + host_name required), Host response structure
- Planned three-phase implementation: Core Infrastructure, Host Operations, Agent Logic & CLI

NEXT STEPS:
1. Create basic project structure with checkmk_mcp_server package
2. Implement CheckmkClient class with authentication
3. Add host operations (list, create, delete)
4. Integrate LLM for natural language processing
5. Build CLI interface

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Modular design with separate clients for Checkmk API and LLM integration
- Configuration management using environment variables
- Error handling and rate limiting for API interactions
- Security considerations for credential management
