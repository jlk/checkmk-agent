# TITLE: Checkmk Rules API Implementation
DATE: 2025-01-10
PARTICIPANTS: User, Claude Code Assistant
SUMMARY: Comprehensive implementation of Checkmk Rules API support including API client methods, LLM integration, CLI commands, and natural language processing capabilities.

INITIAL PROMPT: i want to add support for checkmk rules APIs

KEY DECISIONS:
- Focused specifically on Rules APIs (not rulesets) as clarified by user
- Extended existing architecture rather than creating separate modules
- Added rule operations to HostOperation enum for backward compatibility
- Implemented both direct CLI commands and natural language processing
- Used same Pydantic validation pattern as existing host operations
- Added comprehensive rule management: list, create, delete, get, move operations

FILES CHANGED:
- checkmk_agent/api_client.py: Added CreateRuleRequest, MoveRuleRequest models and 5 rule API methods (list_rules, create_rule, get_rule, delete_rule, move_rule)
- checkmk_agent/llm_client.py: Extended HostOperation enum with rule operations, updated OpenAI/Anthropic prompts, added rule response formatting
- checkmk_agent/host_operations.py: Added 5 rule operation handler methods integrated with existing workflow
- checkmk_agent/cli.py: Added complete rules command group with list, create, delete, get, move subcommands

## CONVERSATION DETAILS

### Context Setting
User requested adding support for Checkmk Rules APIs. Initial research revealed two separate API categories:
- Rules APIs: `/domain-types/rule/collections/all`, `/objects/rule/{rule_id}` 
- Rulesets APIs: `/domain-types/ruleset/collections/all`

User clarified they wanted Rules APIs only, not rulesets.

### Implementation Approach
1. **API Client Extension**: Added Pydantic models and API methods following existing patterns
2. **LLM Integration**: Extended operation enum and updated prompts for both OpenAI and Anthropic
3. **Operations Manager**: Added rule handlers to existing HostOperationsManager 
4. **CLI Interface**: Created new rules command group alongside existing hosts commands
5. **Testing**: Verified integration and backward compatibility

### Technical Implementation

#### API Client Methods Added:
- `list_rules(ruleset_name)` - GET `/domain-types/rule/collections/all?ruleset_name=X`
- `create_rule(ruleset, folder, value_raw, conditions, properties)` - POST `/domain-types/rule/collections/all`
- `get_rule(rule_id)` - GET `/objects/rule/{rule_id}`
- `delete_rule(rule_id)` - DELETE `/objects/rule/{rule_id}`
- `move_rule(rule_id, position, folder, target_rule_id)` - POST `/objects/rule/{rule_id}/actions/move/invoke`

#### LLM Enhancements:
- Extended HostOperation enum: LIST_RULES, CREATE_RULE, DELETE_RULE, GET_RULE, MOVE_RULE
- Updated system prompts to handle rule commands
- Added rule-specific response formatting
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing host operations

#### CLI Commands Added:
- `rules list <ruleset_name>` - List all rules in a ruleset
- `rules create <ruleset_name>` - Create new rule with options
- `rules delete <rule_id>` - Delete rule with confirmation
- `rules get <rule_id>` - Show detailed rule information  
- `rules move <rule_id> <position>` - Move rule position

#### Natural Language Support:
Users can now use natural language commands like:
- "list rules in host_groups"
- "create rule for web servers"
- "delete rule abc123"
- "show me rule details"

### Validation and Testing
- Verified all existing functionality preserved
- Tested rule operations enum and API methods
- Confirmed LLM parsing and response formatting
- Validated CLI command help and structure
- Ensured natural language processing works for rule commands

### Architecture Benefits
- Seamless integration with existing host operations
- Consistent patterns for future API extensions
- Both programmatic and natural language interfaces
- Comprehensive rule management capabilities
- Maintains existing test coverage and reliability

The implementation provides complete rule management functionality while preserving all existing capabilities and following established project patterns.
