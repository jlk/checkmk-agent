TITLE: Enhanced Host Service Status Functionality with Advanced Dashboard and Natural Language Support
DATE: 2025-07-19
PARTICIPANTS: jlk, Claude Code
SUMMARY: Successfully implemented comprehensive enhanced host service status functionality including rich dashboards, advanced natural language processing, CLI filtering options, and fixed critical command routing issues. Added 6 phases of enhancements with visual health indicators, problem categorization, and maintenance recommendations.

INITIAL PROMPT: think hard about adding functionality to show service status for a specified host

KEY DECISIONS:
- Implemented 6-phase enhancement plan for host service status functionality
- Added rich host status dashboard with health metrics, infrastructure comparison, and maintenance recommendations
- Enhanced natural language support with pattern recognition for conversational host queries
- Added comprehensive CLI filtering and sorting options for host status command
- Fixed critical command routing issue where "show critical problems" was not working
- Created host-specific problem categorization and urgency scoring system

FILES CHANGED:
- checkmk_agent/service_status.py: Added get_host_status_dashboard() method with comprehensive host analysis, problem categorization, maintenance recommendations, and 15+ new helper methods
- checkmk_agent/interactive/ui_manager.py: Added format_host_status_dashboard() with rich visual formatting, health bars, color-coded indicators, and trend displays
- checkmk_agent/interactive/command_parser.py: Enhanced natural language patterns for host queries, added contextual conversation tracking, fuzzy hostname matching, and fixed parameter extraction logic
- checkmk_agent/cli.py: Extended status host command with 8 new filtering options (--problems-only, --critical-only, --category, --sort-by, --compact, --no-ok-services, --limit, --dashboard) and added helper functions for service filtering and sorting
- README.md: Updated examples to show enhanced natural language capabilities and new filtering options

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Rich host status dashboards with health percentages, grades (A+ through F), and infrastructure comparison
- Advanced problem categorization by type (disk, network, performance, connectivity, monitoring)
- Urgent issues identification with criticality scoring and recommended actions
- Enhanced natural language support for queries like "How is server01 doing?", "What's wrong with piaware?"
- Comprehensive CLI filtering: problems-only, critical-only, category-based, sorting, compact mode
- Conversation context tracking for follow-up queries ("show problems on that host")
- Fixed critical command routing bug where "show critical problems" was incorrectly parsed

COMMAND ROUTING FIX:
- Root cause: Command parser was extracting "show" as hostname and overriding command extraction with status patterns
- Solution: Added action word filtering in both command extraction and parameter extraction logic
- Fixed patterns that were incorrectly matching compound commands like "show critical problems"
- Added format_warning_services_output() function for warning-specific queries
- Reordered pattern matching precedence in process_status_command() for specific patterns first

FINAL STATUS:
All 6 enhancement phases completed successfully. Host service status functionality now provides comprehensive analysis, intuitive natural language interaction, powerful filtering capabilities, and rich visual dashboards. Command routing issues resolved - "show critical problems" and related commands now work correctly.
