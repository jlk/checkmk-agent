TITLE: Fix Interactive Mode Syntax Error Bug
DATE: 2025-07-17
PARTICIPANTS: User (jlk), Claude Code
SUMMARY: Identified and fixed a critical bug in interactive mode where syntax errors would incorrectly trigger "list hosts" instead of displaying proper error messages. Implemented comprehensive solution with SYNTAX_ERROR operation type, updated fallback logic, and improved error handling.

INITIAL PROMPT: when I run in interactive mode and make a syntax error, the agent displays an error, but then runs list hosts. This isn't right

KEY DECISIONS:
- Added SYNTAX_ERROR operation type to HostOperation enum instead of defaulting to LIST
- Updated both OpenAI and Anthropic client fallback parsing to return SYNTAX_ERROR for unrecognized commands
- Modified error handling in host_operations.py to prevent command execution on syntax errors
- Implemented user-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
- Added comprehensive test coverage for the new behavior

FILES CHANGED:
- checkmk_agent/llm_client.py: Added SYNTAX_ERROR enum value, updated _fallback_parse methods in both OpenAI and Anthropic clients to return SYNTAX_ERROR instead of LIST for unrecognized commands
- checkmk_agent/host_operations.py: Added SYNTAX_ERROR handling in _execute_operation, updated process_command error handling to return simple error messages without triggering operations
- tests/test_host_operations.py: Updated existing error test and added new syntax error test to verify proper behavior
- tasks/fix-interactive-mode-list-hosts-bug.md: Created comprehensive task documentation with problem analysis, solution plan, and implementation status

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
The bug was caused by fallback logic in both LLM clients that defaulted to HostOperation.LIST when parsing failed. This meant that any unrecognized command would be interpreted as a "list hosts" request. The fix involved:

1. Adding SYNTAX_ERROR operation type to the HostOperation enum
2. Updating OpenAI client _fallback_parse() to return SYNTAX_ERROR instead of LIST (line 302)
3. Updating Anthropic client _fallback_parse() to return SYNTAX_ERROR instead of LIST (line 544)
4. Adding SYNTAX_ERROR handling in host_operations.py _execute_operation() method
5. Improving error message format to be more user-friendly

TESTING RESULTS:
- All existing LLM client tests pass (26/26)
- All host operations tests pass (30/30) including new syntax error test
- All service operations tests pass (17/17)
- Created and ran custom test script to verify fallback behavior
- Verified that valid commands still work with proper keyword matching
- Confirmed that syntax errors now show helpful messages without executing commands

BEFORE/AFTER:
- Before: "blah blah invalid" → incorrectly runs "list hosts" 
- After: "blah blah invalid" → displays "❌ Error: Unrecognized command: 'blah blah invalid'. Try 'help' for available commands."

COMMIT: a309f64 - "Fix interactive mode syntax error handling to prevent unintended list hosts execution"

ARCHITECTURE IMPACT:
This change improves the robustness of the natural language processing pipeline by adding proper error handling for unparseable commands. The SYNTAX_ERROR operation type provides a clean separation between valid operations and parsing failures, preventing unintended command execution while maintaining backward compatibility for all existing functionality.
