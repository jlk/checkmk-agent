TITLE: MCP Server Error Monitoring and Critical Fixes
DATE: 2025-07-25
PARTICIPANTS: User (jlk), Claude Code
SUMMARY: Comprehensive error monitoring and fixing of MCP server issues during Claude testing, resolving critical service state display problems and API endpoint mismatches

INITIAL PROMPT: can you watch mcp-server-checkmk.log and fix any new errors as they appear while I test with claude

KEY DECISIONS:
- Identified that services were showing "Unknown" state due to wrong API endpoint usage
- Root cause was CLI using configuration endpoint instead of monitoring endpoint
- Fixed critical state extraction logic that treated 0 (OK) as falsy value
- Implemented comprehensive error monitoring workflow during live testing
- Added new monitoring-specific API methods to handle livestatus data properly

FILES CHANGED:
- checkmk_agent/mcp_server/enhanced_server.py: Fixed parameter mismatches in MCP tool handlers
- checkmk_agent/services/service_service.py: Updated to use monitoring endpoints and added state_type conversion
- checkmk_agent/api_client.py: Added new monitoring data methods (list_host_services_with_monitoring_data, list_all_services_with_monitoring_data)
- checkmk_agent/async_api_client.py: Added async wrappers for new monitoring methods
- checkmk_agent/cli.py: Fixed critical state extraction logic to handle falsy numeric values properly

TECHNICAL ISSUES RESOLVED:
1. **TypeError: ServiceService.list_host_services() got unexpected keyword argument 'include_downtimes'**
   - Fixed by modifying MCP handler to accept but not pass unsupported parameters
   
2. **AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'** in analyze_host_health
   - Fixed by adding type checking to handle both list and dict response formats
   
3. **TypeError: ServiceService.list_all_services() got unexpected keyword argument 'search'**
   - Fixed by removing unsupported parameters and mapping 'search' to 'host_filter'
   
4. **TypeError: CheckmkClient.get_effective_parameters() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given**
   - Fixed by updating async wrapper signature and removing extra parameter
   
5. **Services showing "Unknown" state despite having real states in Checkmk**
   - Root cause: CLI was using wrong API endpoint (/objects/host/{host_name}/collections/services) which returns configuration objects without state data
   - Solution: Created new methods using monitoring endpoint (/domain-types/service/collections/all) which returns livestatus monitoring data with actual states
   
6. **CLI state extraction treating 0 (OK) as falsy**
   - Fixed by using explicit None check instead of 'or' operator
   - Changed from: `service_state = extensions.get('state') or service.get('state', 'Unknown')`
   - To: `service_state = extensions.get('state') if extensions.get('state') is not None else service.get('state', 'Unknown')`
   
7. **Pydantic validation error: state_type expects string but API returns integer**
   - Fixed by adding _convert_state_type_to_string method that converts 0→"soft", 1→"hard"

ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS:
- Discovered critical distinction between Checkmk configuration endpoints and monitoring endpoints
- Configuration endpoints return service definitions without runtime state
- Monitoring endpoints return livestatus data with actual service states and performance metrics
- MCP server now properly handles parameter mismatches between tool schemas and service layer methods

ERROR MONITORING WORKFLOW:
- Implemented real-time log monitoring during user testing
- Used tail -f to continuously watch mcp-server-checkmk.log
- Fixed errors as they appeared in chronological order
- Maintained todo list to track progress on each fix
- Verified fixes by observing successful API calls in log output

TESTING VALIDATION:
- User confirmed services now show correct states (OK, WARNING, CRITICAL) instead of "Unknown"
- MCP server successfully processes list_host_services calls with monitoring data
- API client properly extracts services from monitoring endpoint response format
- State conversion handles both numeric (0,1,2,3) and string ("OK","WARNING","CRITICAL","UNKNOWN") formats
