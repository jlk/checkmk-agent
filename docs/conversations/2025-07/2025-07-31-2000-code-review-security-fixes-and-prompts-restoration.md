TITLE: Comprehensive Code Review, Security Fixes, and MCP Prompts Restoration
DATE: 2025-07-31
PARTICIPANTS: User (jlk), Claude Code
SUMMARY: Conducted thorough code review of commit f36274cb0, implemented critical security fixes for exception handling, and restored the MCP prompts system that was removed during server consolidation.

INITIAL PROMPT: looks good. Can you restore list_prompts() and get_prompt() ?

KEY DECISIONS:
- Implemented comprehensive individual exception handling in all 13+ critical tool handlers to prevent server crashes
- Added error sanitization function to prevent information disclosure through error messages
- Restored 4 MCP workflow automation prompts that were removed during consolidation
- Removed duplicate main function from server.py to maintain clean architecture
- Established mcp_checkmk_server.py as the canonical entry point

FILES CHANGED:
- checkmk_agent/mcp_server/server.py: Added error sanitization, individual exception handling for all tool handlers, restored MCP prompts system with list_prompts() and get_prompt() handlers, removed duplicate main function and debugging artifacts

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- **Security Enhancements**: Added sanitize_error() function that removes sensitive paths and truncates long messages, comprehensive try-catch blocks in acknowledge_service_problem, create_service_downtime, list_hosts, create_host, get_host, update_host, delete_host, list_host_services, list_all_services, get_health_dashboard, get_critical_problems, get_effective_parameters, set_service_parameters
- **MCP Prompts Restored**: analyze_host_health (host health analysis with recommendations), troubleshoot_service (service troubleshooting workflows), infrastructure_overview (infrastructure health dashboards), optimize_parameters (parameter optimization guidance)
- **Architecture Cleanup**: Removed duplicate main function, cleaned up debugging artifacts, standardized entry points
- **Quality Assurance**: All 247 tests pass, no breaking changes, production-ready security posture

VERIFICATION:
- All tests passing (247 passed, 3 skipped)
- Error sanitization working correctly
- MCP prompts system fully functional with real data integration
- Server imports successfully with all security measures
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

IMPACT:
- Prevents MCP server crashes from unhandled exceptions
- Eliminates information disclosure security vulnerabilities  
- Restores valuable AI workflow automation features for Claude integration
- Maintains service availability even when individual operations fail
- Provides intelligent prompts combining real monitoring data with AI analysis
