TITLE: Implement Comprehensive Service Status Monitoring
DATE: 2025-07-19
PARTICIPANTS: jlk, Claude Code
SUMMARY: Successfully implemented complete service status monitoring functionality including health dashboards, problem analysis, and natural language status queries. Fixed critical API issues and command parsing bugs.

INITIAL PROMPT: implement tasks/implement-service-status-monitoring.md ultrathink

KEY DECISIONS:
- Implemented comprehensive 6-phase service status monitoring plan
- Replaced problematic Livestatus queries with local filtering approach for compatibility
- Enhanced command parser to properly route status queries vs service operations
- Added rich UI formatting with progress bars, health indicators, and color coding
- Created extensive test coverage for all new status functionality

FILES CHANGED:
- checkmk_mcp_server/api_client.py: Added 6 new status methods and STATUS_COLUMNS constant, replaced Livestatus queries with fallback filtering
- checkmk_mcp_server/service_status.py: Created new 497-line ServiceStatusManager class with health dashboards and problem analysis
- checkmk_mcp_server/cli.py: Added complete status command group with 7 subcommands for comprehensive status monitoring
- checkmk_mcp_server/interactive/command_parser.py: Enhanced status keyword recognition and parameter extraction for "service status for X" patterns
- checkmk_mcp_server/interactive/ui_manager.py: Added rich status UI methods with health bars, color coding, and visual indicators
- tests/test_service_status.py: Created comprehensive 553-line test suite for ServiceStatusManager functionality
- tests/test_api_client_status.py: Created 531-line API client status method test suite
- README.md: Updated with complete service status monitoring documentation and examples
- test_status_demo.py: Created demonstration script showing full functionality with mock data

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
- Real-time health dashboards with service state distribution and health percentages
- Problem analysis with severity categorization and urgency scoring
- Natural language status queries like "show health dashboard" and "service status for piaware"
- Rich UI with color-coded indicators, progress bars, and visual status representations
- Comprehensive CLI commands: status overview, problems, critical, acknowledged, host, service
- Enhanced interactive mode with status keyword routing and contextual help
- Fallback API approach resolving Livestatus query compatibility issues
- Full test coverage with 29 passing tests across status functionality

FINAL STATUS:
All 6 implementation phases completed successfully. Service status monitoring fully functional with real Checkmk environment showing 309 services across multiple hosts with 96.1% health status. Both "show health dashboard" and "show service status for piaware" commands working perfectly with rich formatted output.
