TITLE: Documentation Reorganization for Open Source Release
DATE: 2025-08-22
PARTICIPANTS: User, Claude Code (Technical Documentation Writer)
SUMMARY: Major documentation reorganization to prepare Checkmk LLM Agent for public GitHub release with streamlined README, comprehensive docs structure, and MIT license

INITIAL PROMPT: ok. The documentation on this project needs organization and cleanup - from the readme to the docs folder. Use the technical doc writer subagent to review the docs and re-organize them and bring clarity. This will be an open-source project that is publicly visible on GitHub, so the readme needs to show why someone would want to use the project, what features it has currently, and how to get started. It's fine to link to deeper docs past the readme.

KEY DECISIONS:
- Complete README transformation from 719 to 144 lines focusing on user value proposition
- Created comprehensive documentation hub in docs/README.md with logical organization
- Added MIT license for open source release
- Established clear getting-started workflow with prerequisites and configuration
- Removed redundant configuration examples in favor of centralized documentation
- Created troubleshooting guide addressing common setup and configuration issues
- Added migration guide for users upgrading from earlier versions
