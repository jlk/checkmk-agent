TITLE: MCP Server Exit Error Elimination - Professional Shutdown Implementation
DATE: 2025-08-23
PARTICIPANTS: User, Claude Code
SUMMARY: Fixed persistent MCP server exit errors that displayed ugly ExceptionGroup and BrokenPipeError tracebacks on shutdown. Implemented comprehensive multi-layered exception handling solution with safe stdio server wrapper, enhanced entry point with stream suppression and exit handlers, and added helpful user guidance for manual terminal usage.

INITIAL PROMPT: when the mcp server exits, it prints this ugly error. Use python architect to get the app to exit more cleanly.

KEY DECISIONS:
- Implemented comprehensive multi-layered exception handling at MCP SDK level
- Added safe stdio server wrapper to catch and suppress MCP-specific errors
- Enhanced entry point with stream suppression for clean shutdown
- Added exit handlers for resource cleanup and graceful termination
- Fixed Claude Desktop configuration path from checkmk_llm_agent to checkmk_mcp_server
- Provided helpful guidance when MCP server is run manually in terminal

FILES CHANGED:
- mcp_checkmk_server.py: Major enhancement with multi-layered exception handling, safe stdio server wrapper, stream suppression, exit handlers, and user guidance for manual terminal execution
- claude_desktop_config.json: Updated configuration path from checkmk_llm_agent to checkmk_mcp_server for correct Claude Desktop integration
