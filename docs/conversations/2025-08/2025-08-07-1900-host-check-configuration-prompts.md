TITLE: Host Check Configuration Prompts Implementation and Documentation Review
DATE: 2025-08-07
PARTICIPANTS: Human User, Claude Code
SUMMARY: Implemented comprehensive host check configuration prompts and conducted technical documentation review to improve accuracy and remove marketing language from project README

INITIAL PROMPT: Update the project documentation to reflect the work completed in this session. Follow the end-of-session checklist:

Today's work included:
1. **README.md Technical Review**: Used technical-doc-editor to improve README accuracy, remove marketing language, fix tool count (47 tools), add limitations section
2. **Host Check Configuration Prompts**: Implemented comprehensive specification and full implementation of 3 new MCP prompts:
   - adjust_host_check_attempts
   - adjust_host_retry_interval  
   - adjust_host_check_timeout
3. **MCP Server Enhancement**: Added ~400 lines of code to server.py with intelligent analysis, network-aware recommendations, and Checkmk API integration

Complete these documentation tasks:

1. **Save Conversation**: Create conversation file in docs/conversations/ for today's session
2. **Update Project History**: Add new entry to docs/project-history.md (keep only 10 most recent, archive older ones)
3. **Update Project Status**: Refresh docs/project-status.md with current status
4. **Write Memory**: Use mcp__serena__write_memory to document today's achievements
5. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Update project focus section to reflect new prompts capability

Use today's date (2025-08-07) and be factual about what was accomplished. Maintain proper chronology and archive older entries as needed.

- Implemented 3 new MCP prompts for host check configuration parameters
- Enhanced technical accuracy of project documentation
