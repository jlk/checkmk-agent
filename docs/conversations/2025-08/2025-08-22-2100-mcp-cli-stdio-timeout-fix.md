PARTICIPANTS: User, Claude Code
SUMMARY: Fixed MCP SDK 1.12.0 stdio transport timeout issues on macOS with intelligent fallback system and enhanced connection logic

INITIAL PROMPT: I need you to create comprehensive session documentation for today's work fixing the MCP CLI stdio communication timeout issues on macOS. Please update all relevant documentation files according to the end-of-session checklist.

KEY DECISIONS:
- Implemented multi-layered timeout strategy (5s fast, 60s patient, 15s overall) for MCP connections
- Added automatic fallback from MCP to direct CLI when stdio communication fails
- Enhanced resource cleanup and connection verification to prevent hanging processes
- Validated architecture as production-ready with senior Python architect review
- Maintained backward compatibility while improving reliability on macOS

FILES CHANGED:
- checkmk_mcp_server/mcp_client.py: Enhanced connection logic with retries and timeouts
- checkmk_mcp_server/cli_mcp.py: Automatic fallback system with argument preservation
- mcp_checkmk_server.py: Improved stdio stream configuration for reliability

## Session Details

### Root Cause Analysis
- Identified MCP SDK 1.12.0 stdio transport timeout issues specifically affecting macOS
- stdio communication hanging indefinitely causing CLI commands to fail
- Issue affected both individual commands and interactive mode

### Technical Solution
1. **Enhanced Connection Logic** (`mcp_client.py`):
   - Multi-layered timeout strategy with fast (5s) and patient (60s) retry modes
   - Comprehensive resource cleanup to prevent zombie processes
   - Connection verification before proceeding with operations

2. **Intelligent Fallback System** (`cli_mcp.py`):
   - Automatic detection of MCP communication failures
   - Seamless fallback to direct CLI with preserved argument handling
   - User-transparent operation with appropriate logging

3. **Improved Server Configuration** (`mcp_checkmk_server.py`):
   - Enhanced stdio stream configuration for better reliability
   - Improved error handling and logging

### Validation Results
- Commands like `python checkmk_cli_mcp.py hosts list` now work correctly
- Interactive mode functioning properly
- All documented examples in `docs/getting-started.md` validated
- Senior architect confirmed production-ready implementation

### Commit Information
- **Commit Hash**: 52711c3
- **Commit Message**: "fix: resolve MCP client stdio communication timeout on macOS"

## Impact
- **User Experience**: MCP CLI now works reliably on macOS without manual intervention
- **Reliability**: Robust fallback ensures commands always execute successfully
- **Maintenance**: Clear separation of concerns between MCP and direct CLI execution
- **Documentation**: All getting-started examples now work as documented

## Architecture Validation
The implementation was reviewed and validated by a senior Python architect who confirmed:
- Production-ready code quality
- Appropriate timeout and retry strategies
- Clean resource management
- Proper error handling and logging
- Maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns
