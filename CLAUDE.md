- **Setup & Configuration**: Host/service management, user management, rules/rulesets
- **Service Discovery**: Automated service detection and configuration
- **Service Management**: Service status monitoring, acknowledgments, downtime scheduling
- **Business Intelligence**: BI operations and analytics
- **Internal Operations**: Certificate management, activation, agent downloads

### Key Endpoints Structure
- Authentication via Checkmk's auth mechanisms
- Resource-oriented REST design
- Comprehensive permission model for each endpoint
- Stateless HTTP/1.1 protocol

## Development Commands

Currently no build system is configured. When implementing:

### Python Implementation (Recommended)
```bash
# Setup virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run agent
python checkmk_mcp_server.py
```

## Architecture Considerations

### API Integration
- **Base URL**: Configure Checkmk server URL
- **Authentication**: Implement Checkmk auth (automation user tokens recommended)
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement throttling for API calls
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of API errors and timeouts

### LLM Integration
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert user queries to API calls
- **Response Formatting**: Convert API responses to human-readable format
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context for multi-step operations

### Security
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage of Checkmk credentials
- **Permission Validation**: Respect Checkmk's permission model
- **Data Sanitization**: Handle sensitive monitoring data appropriately

- Added custom JSON serialization handling for datetime objects
- Worked around MCP SDK v1.12.0 CallToolResult construction bug
- Verified zero errors through real-time log monitoring

## Service Operations Architecture

The service operations functionality is built around these key components:

### 1. API Client Integration (`api_client.py`)
- **Service Status Methods**: `list_host_services()`, `list_all_services()`
- **Service Management**: `acknowledge_service_problems()`, `create_service_downtime()`
- **Service Discovery**: `get_service_discovery_result()`, `start_service_discovery()`
- **Pydantic Models**: Type-safe validation for all service operations

### 2. Service Operations Manager (`service_operations.py`)
- **Natural Language Processing**: Analyzes user commands for service operations
- **Command Routing**: Routes commands to appropriate API methods
- **Response Formatting**: Converts API responses to human-readable format
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with meaningful messages

### 3. CLI Interface (`cli.py`)
- **Services Command Group**: Complete CLI interface for service operations
  - `services list [host_name]` - List services
  - `services status <host> <service>` - Get service status
  - `services acknowledge <host> <service>` - Acknowledge problems
  - `services downtime <host> <service>` - Create downtime
  - `services discover <host>` - Discover services
  - `services stats` - Show service statistics
- **Interactive Mode**: Natural language service commands in interactive mode

### 4. Supported Service Operations

#### Service Status and Monitoring
- **List Services**: View all services for a host or across all hosts
- **Service Status**: Get detailed status information for specific services
- **Service Statistics**: Overview of service states across the infrastructure

#### Service Problem Management
- **Acknowledge Problems**: Acknowledge service problems with comments
- **Create Downtime**: Schedule downtime periods for planned maintenance
- **Sticky/Persistent Options**: Control acknowledgment behavior

#### Service Discovery
- **Automated Discovery**: Discover new services on hosts
- **Discovery Modes**: Multiple discovery modes (refresh, new, remove, fixall)
- **Discovery Results**: Review discovered, vanished, and ignored services

### 5. Natural Language Examples

The system understands commands like:
- `"list services for server01"`
- `"show all services"`
- `"acknowledge CPU load on server01"`
- `"create 4 hour downtime for disk space on server01"`
- `"discover services on server01"`

### 6. Error Handling and Validation

- **API Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all API operations
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models ensure type safety
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages and success confirmations
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff

## Conversation Storage

Conversations with the AI assistant should be saved to preserve context, decisions, and progress. Each conversation must follow this standardized format:

```
TITLE: [Brief topic descriptor]
DATE: YYYY-MM-DD
PARTICIPANTS: [Comma-separated list]
SUMMARY: [Key points and decisions]

INITIAL PROMPT: [User's first substantive message only - exclude any system instructions or project context references]

KEY DECISIONS:
- [Decision point 1]
- [Decision point 2]

FILES CHANGED:
- [File 1] Summary of changes
- [File 2] Summary of changes
```

### Storage Guidelines
- Conversations should be stored in `docs/conversations/` organized by date (YYYY-MM/)
- File naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-[brief-topic-slug].md` 
- **Timestamp Requirements**:
  - Use todays date and time
  - Use **UTC timezone** for all timestamps
  - Use **24-hour format** (HHMM) 
  - Timestamp should reflect **conversation start time** (when user sends first substantive message)
  - To determine UTC time: check current UTC time when conversation begins, or convert local time to UTC
  - Example: If conversation starts at 2:30 PM EST (UTC-5), use `1930` (7:30 PM UTC)
- Conversations that result in architecture decisions should be referenced in the relevant architecture docs
- Conversations that define features should be linked from the project documentation
- **IMPORTANT**: The INITIAL PROMPT must contain only the user's actual first message, not any system instructions about reading project context or role assignments

## Implementation Notes

- The OpenAPI spec is comprehensive (21,353 lines) - use code generation tools when possible
- Focus on core monitoring operations first (acknowledge, downtimes, status checks)
- Consider async operations for real-time monitoring capabilities
- Implement proper logging for debugging API interactions
