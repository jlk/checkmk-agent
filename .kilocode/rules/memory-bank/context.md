# Current Context - Checkmk LLM Agent

## Current Date
2025-08-09

## Current State

The Checkmk LLM Agent is **FULLY OPERATIONAL** with all core features implemented and extensively tested. The system provides natural language control of Checkmk monitoring infrastructure through AI-powered automation.

## Recent Changes

### Request ID Tracing System (2025-08-07)
- Implemented comprehensive request ID infrastructure with 6-digit hex IDs (req_xxxxxx)
- Added thread-safe context propagation using contextvars
- Enhanced logging with RequestIDFormatter for consistent tracking
- Integrated across all 47 MCP tools, API clients, and service layers
- Always-enabled design requiring no configuration

### Host Check Configuration Prompts (2025-08-07)
- Added 3 new MCP prompts for host check parameter management
- Implemented network-aware recommendations based on host characteristics
- Added comprehensive validation with range checking
- Direct Checkmk API integration for rule creation

### Temperature Parameter API Fix (2025-08-03)
- Fixed critical API error for temperature parameter rules
- Implemented automatic integer-to-float conversion for API compliance
- Preserved backward compatibility for non-temperature rulesets
- Added comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

### MCP Server Consolidation (2025-01-31)
- Unified dual server architecture into single implementation
- Consolidated to 47 tools in one MCP server
- Fixed tool registration using proper MCP SDK decorators
- Resolved service state accuracy issues

## Active Work Focus

### Primary Focus
- Memory Bank initialization and documentation
- Knowledge preservation for session continuity
- Comprehensive documentation of system architecture

### Secondary Focus
- Monitoring MCP server stability
- Performance optimization for large deployments
- Parameter handler enhancements

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- MCP SDK v1.12.0 has CallToolResult construction bug (workaround implemented)
- Some datetime serialization requires custom handling (resolved)

### Documentation Gaps
- Need more examples for complex parameter configurations
- Could use more troubleshooting guides

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Complete memory bank initialization
2. Verify all documentation accuracy
3. Test memory bank recall in new sessions

### Short Term
1. Add more specialized parameter handlers
2. Enhance predictive threshold recommendations
3. Implement automated remediation workflows

### Long Term
1. Machine learning for threshold optimization
2. Multi-site federation support
3. Mobile app with voice control

## Environment Details

### Development Environment
- Python 3.8+ with virtual environment
- VS Code with workspace configuration
- MCP SDK v1.12.0 for Claude integration
- Pydantic for data validation

### Testing Status
- All tests passing (100% success rate)
- Request ID tracing validated
- MCP tools verified with Claude Desktop

### Deployment Status
- Production ready
- Can be deployed as MCP server
- CLI interface available
- API endpoints exposed

## Important Context for Future Sessions

1. **Request ID Format**: Always use req_xxxxxx format (6 hex digits)
2. **MCP Tool Count**: Exactly 47 tools - don't claim more or less
3. **Temperature Parameters**: Must be floats, not integers
4. **Service States**: Use monitoring endpoint, not configuration endpoint
5. **Memory Bank**: Located in `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/`

## Session Notes

This memory bank initialization was performed to establish knowledge persistence across sessions. All critical project information has been documented to ensure continuity when memory resets occur.
