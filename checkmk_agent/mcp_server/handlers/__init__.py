MCP Server Handlers Package

This package contains handler implementations for MCP protocol operations
and tool registry management.

Modules:
    - Future handler modules will be added here in later phases
    - tool_registry: Tool registration and metadata management
    - resource_handlers: MCP resource implementations
    - prompt_handlers: Prompt definitions and handlers

This module is part of the Phase 1 refactoring to modularize the monolithic
MCP server implementation.
